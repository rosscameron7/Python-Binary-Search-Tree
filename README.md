# Python Binary Search Tree

This repository contains a Python implementation of a Binary Search Tree (BST). The BST allows for efficient searching, insertion, and traversal of data in a sorted manner.

## Features

- **Insertion**: Add new values to the BST while maintaining the tree's properties.
- **Search**: Find values in the BST efficiently.
- **Traversal Methods**:
  - In-order Traversal: Visits nodes in ascending order.
  - Pre-order Traversal: Visits nodes in root-left-right order.
  - Post-order Traversal: Visits nodes in left-right-root order.

## Installation

To use this implementation, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rosscameron7/Python-Binary-Search-Tree.git
